Dapp and example [Solidity contracts][solidity] demonstrating a straight-forward
token swap.  Useful framework for controlled and secure token upgrades.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.
```bash
$ clone github.com/auser/token-swap-dapp
```

2. Install dependencies.
```bash
$ cd token-swap-dapp && npm install
```

3. Run the development console.
```bash
$ truffle develop
```

4. Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.
```javascript
compile
migrate
```

5. Run the webpack server for front-end hot reloading (outside the development console). Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
```javascript
// Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000
npm run start
```

6. Truffle can run tests written in Solidity or JavaScript against your smart contracts. Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the development console.
```javascript
// If inside the development console.
test

// If outside the development console..
truffle test
```

7. Jest is included for testing React components. Compile your contracts before running Jest, or you may receive some file not found errors.
```javascript
// Run Jest outside of the development console for front-end component tests.
npm run test
```

8. To build the application for production, use the build command. A production build will be in the build_webpack folder.
```javascript
npm run build
```

## Debugging and development

```javascript
REACT_APP_TOKEN_ADDRESS='0xd5de1a88bf957388431dadb6eb5aeeebb636201c'
REACT_APP_CONTROLLER_ADDRESS='0x224813a9bf691586e58a03f4ef3652b38c33d481'
REACT_APP_FACTORY_ADDRESS='0x27bb7642ed4724e94c45a235d6b6f67efcd63369'

controller = SwapController.at(REACT_APP_CONTROLLER_ADDRESS)

YOURADDRESS = '0xbEA369E5a450340A4cAc6bB2AEB8Ffe25B89Ee01'

controller.addToWhitelist(YOURADDRESS)
controller.isWhitelisted(YOURADDRESS)

factory = SwapFactory.at(REACT_APP_FACTORY_ADDRESS)

factory.getContractCount()
```

## FAQ

* __How do I use this with the EthereumJS TestRPC?__

    It's as easy as modifying the config file! [Check out our documentation on adding network configurations](http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration#networks). Depending on the port you're using, you'll also need to update line 24 of `src/utils/getWeb3.js`.

* __Where is my production build?__

    The production build will be in the build_webpack folder. This is because Truffle outputs contract compilations to the build folder.

* __Where can I find more documentation?__

    This box is a marriage of [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) and a React setup created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). Either one would be a great place to start!
